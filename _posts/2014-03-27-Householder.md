We came up with the idea that whenever there is no time to prepare a fancy presentation, we just meet in the usual baNaNa way, have a banana or two, and discuss the details of a famous paper from applied mathematics. 
This is in fact not our idea but is based on the list by Prof. Nick Trefethen, see [his list of 13 classic papers in applied mathematics].

For this time, we chose the shortest, and most interesting paper of his list! That is a paper from 1958 by Householder on the QR decomposition of a matrix. Our idea is that we meet and discuss the paper together using the blackboard only.

Please [download](/presentations/householder/householder.pdf) the QR paper (in Householders' notation it is actually called UR decomposition).
