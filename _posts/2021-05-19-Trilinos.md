[Trilinos] is a collection of more than 50 open-source software packages that can be used as building blocks for all kinds of scientific applications. For example, packages exist for iterative solvers, PDE-constrained optimization problems and automatic differentiation. 

This talk will give a brief introduction to Trilinos. Special attention is paid to the [Tpetra] package that facilitates parallel sparse linear algebra. 


The [slides](/../presentations/trilinos/slides.pdf) of the talk and a small [example](/../presentations/trilinos/tpetra_example.zip) in Tpetra are also available.
