The first lecture will be about how to use [Git] and [Github].  Git is a
powerfull, open source tool that is already installed on our work place
computers and it can be used quite easily for version control of a (larger)
software project.  We will show some of the basic commands and demonstrate how
to use it for a new project.  FYI: This homepage has also been built by
[Joost], [Guido] and [Manuel] using Github.
