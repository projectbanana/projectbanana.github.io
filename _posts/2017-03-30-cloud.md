10 Servers working for an hour cost the same as 100 Servers working for 6 minutes. You should not be waiting for computing results!

This seminar gives an introduction on how to use cloud services for massive parallel computing. We will have a look at two different strategies how cloud computing can be used to process really A LOT for fun and profit, using (almost) real world examples.


Short note about me: I am a DevOps Engineer, helping companies to adopt cloud computing techniques.
