Computational notebooks are based on sequential execution, where one code snippet is dependent on the code above it. This format, although with its own merits, falls short on a couple of fronts. Scientific computing and visualization can become lot more intuitive with the help of "reactive" notebooks.  

In this talk we will learn about [Pluto.jl], a lightweight reactive notebook for Julia.
