We want to meet and present to each other ones favourite LaTeX packages and demonstrate what they do. You are also welcome to join if you only have found a quick-and-dirty solution for a specific task. We can discuss and try to find a better solution!

In particular, we want to distribute templates for TU Delft slides, technical reports, and -most important- Joost's famous [poster class].

Please bring your compilable TeX snippets on a USB stick.
